<project_overview>
Fix the broken vertical alignment within each link box by ensuring logos and text are properly centered on the vertical axis and aligned on the same horizontal line within each individual box, while maintaining grid-wide consistency.
</project_overview>

<core_requirements>
- Logo and text must be vertically centered within each individual 250px box
- Logo and text must be horizontally aligned on the same line within each box
- Maintain consistent visual alignment across all boxes in the grid
- Preserve existing functionality including hover effects and responsive behavior
- Keep 250px width and existing spacing/padding structure
- All content should appear properly aligned and professional
</core_requirements>

<technical_constraints>
- Work within existing iframe structure at `/public/img/iframe.html`
- Fix current broken baseline alignment implementation
- Use proper flexbox alignment properties
- Maintain compatibility with existing 3x3 grid layout
- Preserve responsive breakpoints and mobile single-column layout
- Keep existing 25x25px logo sizing and spacing
</technical_constraints>

<implementation_details>
- **Current Issue**: Baseline alignment has broken vertical centering within each box
- **Required Fix**: Return to centered alignment within each box while achieving cross-grid consistency
- **Logo Alignment**: Logo should be vertically centered within the box height
- **Text Alignment**: Text should be vertically centered and inline with logo
- **Cross-Grid Consistency**: All logos should appear at consistent height, all text at consistent baseline
- **CSS Approach**: 
  - Use `align-items: center` for proper within-box alignment
  - Consider alternative methods for cross-grid alignment consistency
  - Ensure proper vertical centering with appropriate padding/margins
