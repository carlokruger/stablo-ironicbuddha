ok let's do some work on the home page. create a new branch called homepage so we can isolate the changes. Currently the home page is just a static page. I'd like to use it more effectively by highlighting the last 3 posts. First investigate the existing "Featured" function and what it does. If it places featured posts on teh home page then we're 90% of the way there. If that is not how the "Featured" option works, we want to create custom code that we will create a carousel of the last three posts

<project_overview>
Transform the static homepage into a dynamic content showcase by implementing a display of the 3 most recent blog posts. First investigate existing "Featured" post functionality to determine if it can be leveraged, then implement either enhanced Featured post display or a custom recent posts carousel.
