<project_overview>
Refine the visual alignment of logos and text within the streaming platform link boxes to create consistent vertical alignment of logos across boxes, baseline alignment of text, while maintaining overall centered content within each box.
</project_overview>

<core_requirements>
- Create consistent vertical alignment of all logos across different link boxes
- Align text based on baseline/first letter positioning for uniform text alignment
- Maintain overall centering of logo+text content within each 250px box
- Preserve existing functionality including hover effects and responsive behavior
- Apply alignment improvements across all responsive breakpoints
- Keep existing 25x25px logo sizing and 10px margin-right spacing
</core_requirements>

<technical_constraints>
- Work within existing iframe structure at `/public/img/iframe.html`
- Modify existing `.link`, `.link img`, and `.link span` CSS classes
- Maintain compatibility with flexbox layout already in place
- Preserve current responsive grid and single-column layouts
- Must work across different logo file formats (PNG, SVG)
- Keep existing box-sizing, padding, and margin structure
</technical_constraints>

<implementation_details>
- **Current Structure**: Flexbox with `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, `justify-content: center`
- **Logo Alignment**: Ensure all 25x25px logos sit at consistent vertical position regardless of text length
- **Text Alignment**: Use `align-items: baseline` or similar to align text by first letter baseline
- **Content Centering**: Maintain overall centering while allowing for fine-tuned logo/text positioning
- **CSS Properties to Adjust**:
  - `.link` container alignment properties
  - `.link img` vertical positioning
  - `.link span` baseline alignment
  - Potential use of `align-items: baseline` vs `align-items: center`
  - Consider `vertical-align` properties if needed
</implementation_details>

<success_criteria>
- All logos appear at the same vertical height across all link boxes
- Text baselines (first letters) are consistently aligned across boxes
- Overall content remains visually centered within each 250px box
- No layout breaking or overflow issues introduced
- Alignment improvements visible across all responsive breakpoints
- Hover effects and interactions remain functional
- Visual consistency maintained across different text lengths (e.g., "apple music" vs "spotify")
</success_criteria>

<nice_to_have>
- Consider optical alignment adjustments for different logo designs
- Fine-tune spacing if baseline alignment affects visual balance
- Potential micro-adjustments for logos with different visual weights
- Enhanced typography spacing for better readability
- Consideration of how alignment looks with future logo additions
