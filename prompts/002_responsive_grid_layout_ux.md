<project_overview>
Improve the UX of the contact page by implementing a responsive 3x3 grid layout for the streaming platform and social media links on landscape/wider viewports, while maintaining optimal spacing and visual hierarchy.
</project_overview>

<core_requirements>
- Convert single-column link layout to 3x3 grid for landscape viewports
- Maintain single-column layout for mobile/portrait orientations
- Implement proper responsive breakpoints for layout transitions
- Preserve all existing styling, hover effects, and functionality
- Ensure adequate whitespace between grid items to prevent crowding
- All 9 current links must fit perfectly in the 3x3 grid arrangement
</core_requirements>

<technical_constraints>
- Work within existing iframe HTML structure at `/public/img/iframe.html`
- Must maintain compatibility with existing CSS variables and styling
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive grid implementation
- Preserve existing `.link` class styling and hover effects
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility for grid layout
- Maintain accessibility standards and keyboard navigation
</technical_constraints>

<implementation_details>
- **Current Links Count**: 9 total (soundcloud, mixcloud, bandcamp, apple music, spotify, beatport, mastodon, zuckbook, email)
- **Grid Layout**: 3 columns × 3 rows for landscape viewports
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 
  - Mobile/Portrait: Single column (current behavior)
  - Tablet/Landscape: 3x3 grid layout
  - Desktop: 3x3 grid with optimized spacing
- **Spacing Requirements**:
  - Adequate gap between grid items (suggest 15-20px)
